# Project Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for Codex CLI.

<!-- BEGIN: BMAD-AGENTS -->
# BMAD-METHOD Agents and Tasks

This section is auto-generated by BMAD-METHOD for Codex. Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.

## How To Use With Codex

- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., "As dev, implement ...".
- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.
- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.
- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.

### Helpful Commands

- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`
- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`
- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`

### UX Expert (id: ux-expert)
Source: .bmad-core/agents/ux-expert.md

- When to use: Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization
- How to activate: Mention "As ux-expert, ..." or "Use UX Expert to ..."

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md ‚Üí .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"‚Üí*create‚Üícreate-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

### BMad Master Orchestrator (id: bmad-orchestrator)
Source: .bmad-core/agents/bmad-orchestrator.md

- When to use: Use for workflow coordination, multi-agent tasks, role switching guidance, and when unsure which specialist to consult
- How to activate: Mention "As bmad-orchestrator, ..." or "Use BMad Master Orchestrator to ..."

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md ‚Üí .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"‚Üí*create‚Üícreate-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - Announce: Introduce yourself as the BMad Orchestrator, explain you can coordinate agents and workflows
  - IMPORTANT: Tell users that all commands start with * (e.g., `*help`, `*agent`, `*workflow`)
  - Assess user goal against available agents and workflows in this bundle
  - If clear match to an agent's expertise, suggest transformation with *agent command
  - If project-oriented, suggest *workflow-guidance to explore options
  - Load resources only when needed - never pre-load (Exception: Read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` during activation)
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

- How to use: "Use task validate-next-story with the appropriate agent" and paste relevant parts as needed.

```md
<!-- Powered by BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core -->

# Validate Next Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient context for successful development. This task identifies issues and gaps that need to be addressed, preventing hallucinations and ensuring implementation readiness.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs

- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story validation."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`
- Identify and load the following inputs:
  - **Story file**: The drafted story to validate (provided by user or discovered in `devStoryLocation`)
  - **Parent epic**: The epic containing this story's requirements
  - **Architecture documents**: Based on configuration (sharded or monolithic)
  - **Story template**: `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` for completeness validation

### 1. Template Completeness Validation

- Load `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` and extract all section headings from the template
- **Missing sections check**: Compare story sections against template sections to verify all required sections are present
- **Placeholder validation**: Ensure no template placeholders remain unfilled (e.g., `{{EpicNum}}`, `{{role}}`, `_TBD_`)
- **Agent section verification**: Confirm all sections from template exist for future agent use
- **Structure compliance**: Verify story follows template structure and formatting

### 2. File Structure and Source Tree Validation

- **File paths clarity**: Are new/existing files to be created/modified clearly specified?
- **Source tree relevance**: Is relevant project structure included in Dev Notes?
- **Directory structure**: Are new directories/components properly located according to project structure?
- **File creation sequence**: Do tasks specify where files should be created in logical order?
- **Path accuracy**: Are file paths consistent with project structure from architecture docs?

### 3. UI/Frontend Completeness Validation (if applicable)

- **Component specifications**: Are UI components sufficiently detailed for implementation?
- **Styling/design guidance**: Is visual implementation guidance clear?
- **User interaction flows**: Are UX patterns and behaviors specified?
- **Responsive/accessibility**: Are these considerations addressed if required?
- **Integration points**: Are frontend-backend integration points clear?

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction Assessment

- **AC coverage**: Will all acceptance criteria be satisfied by the listed tasks?
- **AC testability**: Are acceptance criteria measurable and verifiable?
- **Missing scenarios**: Are edge cases or error conditions covered?
- **Success definition**: Is "done" clearly defined for each AC?
- **Task-AC mapping**: Are tasks properly linked to specific acceptance criteria?

### 5. Validation and Testing Instructions Review

- **Test approach clarity**: Are testing methods clearly specified?
- **Test scenarios**: Are key test cases identified?
- **Validation steps**: Are acceptance criteria validation steps clear?
- **Testing tools/frameworks**: Are required testing tools specified?
- **Test data requirements**: Are test data needs identified?

### 6. Security Considerations Assessment (if applicable)

- **Security requirements**: Are security needs identified and addressed?
- **Authentication/authorization**: Are access controls specified?
- **Data protection**: Are sensitive data handling requirements clear?
- **Vulnerability prevention**: Are common security issues addressed?
- **Compliance requirements**: Are regulatory/compliance needs addressed?

### 7. Tasks/Subtasks Sequence Validation

- **Logical order**: Do tasks follow proper implementation sequence?
- **Dependencies**: Are task dependencies clear and correct?
- **Granularity**: Are tasks appropriately sized and actionable?
- **Completeness**: Do tasks cover all requirements and acceptance criteria?
- **Blocking issues**: Are there any tasks that would block others?

### 8. Anti-Hallucination Verification

- **Source verification**: Every technical claim must be traceable to source documents
- **Architecture alignment**: Dev Notes content matches architecture specifications
- **No invented details**: Flag any technical decisions not supported by source documents
- **Reference accuracy**: Verify all source references are correct and accessible
- **Fact checking**: Cross-reference claims against epic and architecture documents

### 9. Dev Agent Implementation Readiness

- **Self-contained context**: Can the story be implemented without reading external docs?
- **Clear instructions**: Are implementation steps unambiguous?
- **Complete technical context**: Are all required technical details present in Dev Notes?
- **Missing information**: Identify any critical information gaps
- **Actionability**: Are all tasks actionable by a development agent?

### 10. Generate Validation Report

Provide a structured validation report including:

#### Template Compliance Issues

- Missing sections from story template
- Unfilled placeholders or template variables
- Structural formatting issues

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

- Missing essential information for implementation
- Inaccurate or unverifiable technical claims
- Incomplete acceptance criteria coverage
- Missing required sections

#### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- Unclear implementation guidance
- Missing security considerations
- Task sequencing problems
- Incomplete testing instructions

#### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Additional context that would help implementation
- Clarifications that would improve efficiency
- Documentation improvements

#### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- Unverifiable technical claims
- Missing source references
- Inconsistencies with architecture documents
- Invented libraries, patterns, or standards

#### Final Assessment

- **GO**: Story is ready for implementation
- **NO-GO**: Story requires fixes before implementation
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 1-10 scale
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low for successful implementation

# trace-requirements

Map story requirements to test cases using Given-When-Then patterns for comprehensive traceability.

## Purpose

Create a requirements traceability matrix that ensures every acceptance criterion has corresponding test coverage. This task helps identify gaps in testing and ensures all requirements are validated.

**IMPORTANT**: Given-When-Then is used here for documenting the mapping between requirements and tests, NOT for writing the actual test code. Tests should follow your project's testing standards (no BDD syntax in test code).

## Prerequisites

- Story file with clear acceptance criteria
- Access to test files or test specifications
- Understanding of the implementation

## Traceability Process

### 1. Extract Requirements

Identify all testable requirements from:

- Acceptance Criteria (primary source)
- User story statement
- Tasks/subtasks with specific behaviors
- Non-functional requirements mentioned
- Edge cases documented

### 2. Map to Test Cases

For each requirement, document which tests validate it. Use Given-When-Then to describe what the test validates (not how it's written):

```yaml
requirement: 'AC1: User can login with valid credentials'
test_mappings:
  - test_file: 'auth/login.test.ts'
    test_case: 'should successfully login with valid email and password'
    # Given-When-Then describes WHAT the test validates, not HOW it's coded
    given: 'A registered user with valid credentials'
    when: 'They submit the login form'
    then: 'They are redirected to dashboard and session is created'
    coverage: full

  - test_file: 'e2e/auth-flow.test.ts'
    test_case: 'complete login flow'
    given: 'User on login page'
    when: 'Entering valid credentials and submitting'
    then: 'Dashboard loads with user data'
    coverage: integration
```

### 3. Coverage Analysis

Evaluate coverage for each requirement:

**Coverage Levels:**

- `full`: Requirement completely tested
- `partial`: Some aspects tested, gaps exist
- `none`: No test coverage found
- `integration`: Covered in integration/e2e tests only
- `unit`: Covered in unit tests only

### 4. Gap Identification

Document any gaps found:

```yaml
coverage_gaps:
  - requirement: 'AC3: Password reset email sent within 60 seconds'
    gap: 'No test for email delivery timing'
    severity: medium
    suggested_test:
      type: integration
      description: 'Test email service SLA compliance'

  - requirement: 'AC5: Support 1000 concurrent users'
    gap: 'No load testing implemented'
    severity: high
    suggested_test:
      type: performance
      description: 'Load test with 1000 concurrent connections'
```

## Outputs

### Output 1: Gate YAML Block

**Generate for pasting into gate file under `trace`:**

```yaml
trace:
  totals:
    requirements: X
    full: Y
    partial: Z
    none: W
  planning_ref: 'qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md'
  uncovered:
    - ac: 'AC3'
      reason: 'No test found for password reset timing'
  notes: 'See qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md'
```

### Output 2: Traceability Report

**Save to:** `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`

Create a traceability report with:

```markdown
# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: {epic}.{story} - {title}

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: X
- Fully Covered: Y (Z%)
- Partially Covered: A (B%)
- Not Covered: C (D%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: {Acceptance Criterion 1}

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `auth.service.test.ts::validateCredentials`
  - Given: Valid user credentials
  - When: Validation method called
  - Then: Returns true with user object

- **Integration Test**: `auth.integration.test.ts::loginFlow`
  - Given:
